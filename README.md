# Campus-Placement-Project
Campus recruitment is a strategy for sourcing, engaging and hiring young talent for internship and entry-level positions. 
College recruiting is typically a tactic for medium- to large-sized companies with high-volume recruiting needs, 
but can range from small efforts (like working with university career centers to source potential candidates) to large-scale operations (like visiting a wide array of colleges and attending recruiting events throughout the spring and fall semester).
Campus recruitment often involves working with university career services centers and attending career fairs to meet in-person with college students and recent graduates.
Our dataset revolves around the placement season of a Business School in India. 
Where it has various factors on candidates getting hired such as work experience, exam percentage etc., 
Finally it contains the status of recruitment and remuneration details.
